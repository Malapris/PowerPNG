Technical considerations :
- PowerPNG will NOT DROP any files but your PNG files will be REPLACED by smaller ones (with the same name), only if the size is smaller.
- PowerPNG is a batch DOS script who launches a powershell script who lanches PNGQUANT (for effective compression)
- The binary file of PNGQUANT is provided with no known viruses. Please refer to PNGQUANT website for original and updated software : https://pngquant.org/
